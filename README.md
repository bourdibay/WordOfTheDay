# WordOfTheDay
Offline viewer of the "Word of the Day" of wordreference.com

## Presentation
Everyday a "Word of the day" is released on https://daily.wordreference.com/
I made this application to be able to study them offline in the subway.
Each time you launch the app, the list of words is refreshed with the new released words you missed since the previous update.

Are displayed:
1. the word of the day
2. its definition
3. the examples of usage
4. the "often used" section

At the first run, all words are downloaded from https://daily.wordreference.com/all-words/
This takes a lot of time (at least 1 hour). Everything is stored in an internal database for offline queries.
